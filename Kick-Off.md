## Project Description
In this project, you will do and present an analysis of your choosing on a topic related to Barcelona.

The topics are:  
* Transportation
* Urban environment
* Population 
* Administration
* Economics & business

In this project you will work in **teams**. Your team must come to an agreement with the other teams so that each of you work on a different topic. 

Possible datasets you can use are suggested in the ```Dataset``` section below. 

## Project Goals
During this project you will:
* Fork and manage your own git repository. 
* Propose interesting questions to answer using data.
* Search and explore data that will help you answer your questions. 
* Build a database.
* Perform a simple analysis and identify interesting insights.
* Get used to public presentations. 
* Learn something about Barcelona!

## Requirements & Deliverables
The **mandatory** requirements that this project needs to satisfy are: 
* The project must be planned. That is why creating a Kanban or Trello Board is important. You can find a template for Trello [here](https://trello.com/b/usAykV9K/project-2-barcelona). Remember that you **CAN'T CODE** until your project is planned. 
* Your repository must be clean and organized, which means that it must include a *.gitignore* file and a README file, as well as have a well-structured file organization.  
* Your README file must clearly include which topic you chose and which are the questions you would like to answer.
* Your project must include a database design and a complete analysis of your data including the most meaningful insights you found.
* Also, mind that **NO PLOTTING IS ALLOWED IN THIS PROJECT**.

The **mandatory** deliverables that you must turn in are:
* Link to the repository you used while building your project. The repository must include all the files you used to complete your analysis. Remember to commit often to avoid trouble in case you mess up: this means more than 1 commit!
* Link to Trello or picture of your Kanban Board. Include the link or picture in the README file. 
* An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) that describes the structure you designed for your database. You don't need to specify the datatypes of each column, only the tables you will create, the columns they have and the relationships between the tables. Include the ERD in your README file as an image. 

The **deadline** to turn in the deliverables is right before the project presentations.

## Mentoring
One of the TAs will be your mentor!

Your mentor will:
* Keep track of your project in general terms. Your mentor will be the second person that knows more about the project, after you.
* Check if you are following your plan: are you keeping up with your tasks and deadlines? Do you have any obstacles blocking you?
* Help/support you with specific questions.

Your mentor is **not** meant to:
* Know everything.
* Be your manager. You have to be responsible of your own tasks!

## Schedule

| Tuesday - Wednesday |  
|:--------:|
* Choose your topic.
* Propose interesting questions to answer. 
* Brainstorm to find out which data you can use to answer your questions.
* Research and look for the data. You can find some useful links to investigate in the ```Resources``` section.
* Fork the project repository and edit the README overview. You can find a [template](https://github.com/ta-data-bcn/Project-Week-2-Barcelona/blob/master/your-project/README.md) for your README file in this repository. Remember to keep the README up-to-date.

| Wednesday |  
|:--------:|
* Plan your project. Remember that we are providing you with a Trello [template](https://trello.com/b/usAykV9K/project-2-barcelona). Define tasks, specifying those to be done individually and those to be done together.
* Once you finish, start coding!
* Clean your data.
* Design and build your database. 

| Thursday |  
|:--------:|
* Analyse your data. 
* Find the most interesting and meaningful insights.
* Start preparing the slides for Friday's presentation.

## Presentation
The presentation time limit is **10 minutes**! After all the presentations are over, there will be a 5-minutes break. After the break, we will hold a short debate about the projects.

Our suggestion is to include at least the following slides in your presentation but feel free to add or remove slides:

* Title of the project
* Team presentation
* Goals
* Data - sources, problems and limitations
* Database - data pre-processing and database structure
* Main insights 
* Questions you were not able to answer and why
* Main learnings: what could you have done better? What was useful?

**Remember to present your insights as understandably as possible without using plots!**

## Tips & Tricks
* Question first. Data second.
* Before coding, think about the workflow of your analysis.
* You will have more questions than answers. It's not a problem if you can't answer some or any of your questions. Just show us why you couldn't answer, that itself will be interesting!

## Asking Questions
Imagine that our project is about the population of Barcelona.
We could, for example, try to answer a *descriptive* question such as: How many people are living in my neighbourhood? And you would need to look for specific data that can answer that question.
But your question could also be an *analytic* one such as: Is my neighbourhood the best? In this case you will need to think what the word *best* best means. For example it could mean:
* Safer
* More cultural events
* More schools
* ...

Analytic questions require you to think about the *how* of answering a question.
This is one of the most interesting part of the process and you will be doing it for the rest of the bootcamp.
